# E-Corp Employee Dashboard

For the 4th Project of the Code Institute Course, I decided to make a Dashboard for all Employees of the E-Corp IT Department. The inspiration of E-Corp came from the Prime Series called "Mr. Robot". We can see the current employees in the IT Department whilst being to manipulate their data at the same time.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

E-Corp Employee Dashboard is a simple Dashboard Application that allows users(site admins) to see and edit the current members of staff in the IT-Department. This website is not made for just any normal user to log in and start manipulating data. This is an internal product created by the Engineers from the the Company "E-Corp" that is used to manage their IT Department Employee Tables. So, only E-Corp IT System Administrators can create accounts and add, delete and or make changes to their IT Department Staff.

#### Key information for the site

* Who are the current employees in the IT Department?
* Can I add new members to the IT Team?
* Can I change the employees details?
* Can I remove one or more employees from the List?
* Product is only for E-Corp IT Admins

### User Stories

#### User Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To make changes to the Employees details very fast and easy.
* To edit the Employee List any time I want.
* To help potential new Users understand the system better.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour palette was created using the [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) website.
![E-Corp Dashboard Palette](media/palette.png)

### Typography

Bootstrap v5.3.1 was used for all fonts in this Application.

### Imagery

No Images were used in the Production of this Project.

## Features

This website contains 4 Pages and that is the Home Page, Edit Page, Login and Register Page. The Home and Edit page are only accessible if the User has logged in.

* Home Page:
  * Header
  * Add Employee(s)
  * See Current Employees

* Edit Page:
  * Header
  * Edit Formula

* Login Page:
  * Login Form (Username + Password)

* Register Page:
  * Register Form (Username, Password, Repeat Password)

### Accessibility
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using well structured HTML.
* Using Bootstrap to help aid with the UI/UX.
* Making the Website fully responsive.
* Ensuring that the website is fully functional as well as being nice to look at.
* Making the App very User Friendly even for Non-Technical People.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
* HTML was used to create the Templating
* Python was used to create the entire app logic

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
* Django - Main focus and used as backend framework to create functionality and features.
* Bootstrap - Using Colors, CSS Classes and Fonts to make the website pretty and responsive.
* SQL - For saving User Data
* [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) To show the website image on a range of devices.
* Git - For version control.
* Github - To save and store the files for the website.
* Google Dev Tools - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.

## Deployment & Local Development

#### Local Deployment  
1. Clone the repository from GitHub by clicking the "Code" button and copying the URL.
2. Open your preferred IDE and open a terminal session in the directory you want to clone the repository to.
3. Type `git clone` followed by the URL you copied in step 1 and press enter.
4. Install the required dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
5. Note: The project is setup to use environment variables. You will need to set these up in your local environment. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more information.
6. Connect your database of choice and run the migrations by typing `python manage.py migrate` in the terminal.
7. Create a superuser by typing `python manage.py createsuperuser` in the terminal and following the prompts.
8. Optional: Fixtures for Flight, Airport and Aircraft models are included in the project in the `fixtures` directory. To add pre-populated data to the database, run `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/[fixture_name].json`.
9. Run the app by typing `python manage.py runserver` in the terminal and opening the URL in your browser.

#### Heroku Deployment
1. Login to the Heroku dashboard and create a new app.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to your Heroku app.
3. In the Settings tab, ensure that the Python Buildpack is added.
4. Set environment variables in the Config Vars section of the Settings tab.
5. In the Deploy tab, enable automatic deploys from your GitHub repository.
6. Click the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy the app.
7. Once the app has been deployed, click the "Open App" button to view the app.
8. If using S3, you will need to set up an S3 bucket and add the environment variables to your Heroku app (see tutorial [here](https://testdriven.io/blog/storing-django-static-and-media-files-on-amazon-s3/) for reference.)

4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing
Testing was conducted very carefully through the entire project. As a heads up, since I had no pure HTML and instead had Django HTML the W3C Validator listed some errors due to the Django Knowledge but does not cause any problems in terms of functionality.

### AUTOMATED TESTING

#### Â W3C Validator
Again since it wasnt pure HTML these errors are mostly to do with Django Syntax. And both of these files (Base.html & Edit.html) errors were too long to fit in one screenshot, therefore I provided with 2.

##### Home/Main Page (I called it base)
![Base.html W3C](media/base1.png)
![Base.html W3C](media/base2.png)

##### Edit Page to edit Employee Information
![Edit.html W3C](media/edit1.png)
![Edit.html W3C](media/edit2.png)

##### Login Page (To Log In with your Credentials)
![Login.html W3C](media/login.png)

##### Register Page (To Log In with your Credentials)
![Register.html W3C](media/register.png)

#### Pylint
Python Code was tested using Code Institute's own [Pylinter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

##### Models.py

##### urls.py

##### Forms.py

##### Views.py

  * iPhone XR
  * iPad Air
  * Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra

## BUGS

### Known Bugs
1. There was a Bug that when a IT Admin clicked on the Delete Button it would delete in the Backend Database but not show in real-time in the Frontend.

2. The Edit Button did not:
  * Go to the Edit Form
  * It would not display the editted Information in the Frontend nor Backend.

3. HTML Text Input Fields allowed empty spaces as valid input.

4. When Loggin In it would not direct you to the correct page i.e. The Employee Dashboard

### Solved Bugs
All Bugs listed above were solved and the page is fully functional and running without any Django or Console Errors (expect for missing Favicon.ico - but we do not have that).
