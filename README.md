# E-Corp Employee Dashboard

For the 4th Project of the Code Institute Course, I decided to make a Dashboard for all Employees of the E-Corp IT Department. The inspiration of E-Corp came from the Prime Series called "Mr. Robot". We can see the current employees in the IT Department whilst being to manipulate their data at the same time.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

E-Corp Employee Dashboard is a simple Dashboard Application that allows users(site admins) to see and edit the current members of staff in the IT-Department.

#### Key information for the site

* Who are the current employees in the IT Department?
* Can I add new members to the IT Team?
* Can I change the employees details?
* Can I remove one or more employees from the List?

### User Stories

#### User Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To make changes to the Employees details very fast and easy.
* To edit the Employee List any time I want.
* To help potential new Users understand the system better.
