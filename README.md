# E-Corp Employee Dashboard

For the 4th Project of the Code Institute Course, I decided to make a Dashboard for all Employees of the E-Corp IT Department. The inspiration of E-Corp came from the Prime Series called "Mr. Robot". We can see the current employees in the IT Department whilst being to manipulate their data at the same time.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

E-Corp Employee Dashboard is a simple Dashboard Application that allows users(site admins) to see and edit the current members of staff in the IT-Department.

#### Key information for the site

* Who are the current employees in the IT Department?
* Can I add new members to the IT Team?
* Can I change the employees details?
* Can I remove one or more employees from the List?

### User Stories

#### User Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To make changes to the Employees details very fast and easy.
* To edit the Employee List any time I want.
* To help potential new Users understand the system better.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour palette was created using the [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) website.

## Features

This website contains 4 Pages and that is the Home Page, Edit Page, Login and Register Page. The Home and Edit page are only accessible if the User has logged in.

### Accessibility
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using well structured HTML.
* Using Bootstrap to help aid with the UI/UX.
* Making the Website fully responsive.
* Ensuring that the website is fully functional as well as being nice to look at.
* Making the App very User Friendly even for Non-Technical People.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
* HTML was used to create the Templating
* Python was used to create the entire app logic

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
* Django - Main focus and used as backend framework to create functionality and features.
* Bootstrap - Using Colors, CSS Classes and Fonts to make the website pretty and responsive.
